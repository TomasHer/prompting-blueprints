## How to use this guide
- Match latency needs: pick Groq, xAI, or Together AI when low-latency responses matter most.
- Optimize for safety: lean on OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, or Baidu/Zhipu AI for stronger alignment guardrails.
- Control costs: consider Deepseek, Mistral AI, Gradient, Snowflake, or LLM360 when budgets are tight.
- Prioritize deployment model: choose AWS, Snowflake, or NVIDIA when enterprise security and private hosting are required; select open-weight options (Meta, Mistral, LLM360) for self-managed stacks.
- Personalize outputs: Character and NovelAI specialize in persona or creative styles that improve immersion.

## Agent selection checklist for 2026
- Clarify the agent’s core job: retrieval-first, reasoning-heavy, creative, or automation-focused.
- Verify model availability in your stack (cloud-managed API vs. on-prem vs. edge deployment).
- Check licensing and data residency, especially for regulated industries or region-locked providers.
- Run quick evaluations on latency, cost per 1K tokens, and tool-use reliability before rollout.
- Keep a fallback model per region to handle outages or policy blocks.
