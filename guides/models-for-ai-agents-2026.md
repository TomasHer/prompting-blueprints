| Google | Gemini 3, Gemma 3, Nanobanana Pro | Search-native agents with massive accurate context window. |
| Anthropic | Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5 | Coding agents and safety-critical agents for law and medical care. |
| xAI | Grok 4.1, Grok Code Fast 1, Grok Imagine | High-throughput agents tightly coupled to more coherent answers. |
| Perplexity | Sonar Pro, Sonar Small, R1-1776 | Research and analyst copilots that synthesize web sources into reports. |
| Deepseek | DS-V3.2, DS-R1-0528, DS-OCR | Cost-efficient, high-throughput coding and math agents. |
| Mistral AI | Mistral Large 3, Devstral 2, Ministral 3 3B | Lightweight, latency-sensitive agents deployable on-prem. |
| Qwen | Q3-235B-A22B, Qwen3-32B, Q-VL-Max | Cost Effective Generalist agents with massive multi-lingual support. |
| Microsoft | MAI-1-preview, PHI-4, MAI-Voice-1 | Enterprise copilots and general use case agents for smaller workflows. |
| Meta | Llama 4 Maverick, Llama 4 Scout, SAM 3 | Customizable RAG agents wanting full control, fine-tuning, and self-hosting. |
| Moonshot AI | Kimi K2 Thinking, Kimi K2, Kimi Dev | Long-context reasoning agents for extended Deep research tasks. |
| AWS | Nova 2 Pro, Nova 2 Lite, Nova 2 Sonic | Highly scalable, serverless agent backends running inside AWS stacks. |
| IBM | Granite 4, Granite 4 Micro, G 3.2 8B Instruct | Regulated-industry models emphasizing governance and audit ability. |
| Z AI | GLM-4.6, GLM-4.5V, GLM-4-0520 | Best for Agentic Coding and Computer vision capabilities. |
| NVIDIA | Nemotron-51B, NVLM1.0, NeMo Megatron | High-performance multimodal and domain-specific agents. |

## How to use this guide
- Match throughput needs: pick xAI or Deepseek when high-throughput responses matter most.
- Prioritize research and context: lean on Google for search-native context, Perplexity for research synthesis, and Moonshot AI for long-context deep research tasks.
- Optimize for safety or regulation: use Anthropic for safety-critical flows and IBM for governance- and audit-forward requirements.
- Control costs and deployment: consider Mistral AI for on-prem latency-sensitive stacks or Meta for self-hosting and fine-tuning.
- Scale enterprise backends: choose AWS for serverless agent backends and NVIDIA for high-performance multimodal workloads.

## Agent selection checklist for 2026
- Clarify the agent’s core job: retrieval-first, reasoning-heavy, creative, or automation-focused.
- Verify model availability in your stack (cloud-managed API vs. on-prem vs. edge deployment).
- Check licensing and data residency, especially for regulated industries or region-locked providers.
- Run quick evaluations on latency, cost per 1K tokens, and tool-use reliability before rollout.
- Keep a fallback model per region to handle outages or policy blocks.
