# Understanding AI Agents

## Overview
AI agents are software systems that use artificial intelligence techniques to perceive information, reason about it, and take actions toward a goal. According to Google Cloud's overview, modern AI agents combine language models with orchestrated tools and data sources so that they can observe real-world signals, plan multi-step solutions, and act autonomously or semi-autonomously on a user's behalf. These systems often integrate perception, reasoning, and action loops to deliver adaptive, context-aware assistance.

## Core Capabilities
- **Perception**: Agents ingest structured and unstructured data, including natural language, to understand user intent and environmental context.
- **Reasoning and Planning**: They evaluate goals, decompose tasks, and determine appropriate next steps using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting and planning heuristics.
- **Action and Learning**: Agents execute tasks by calling external tools, invoking APIs, or generating content, and they refine their behavior based on feedback loops and updated context.

## Architectural Elements
1. **Interface Layer** – Handles conversations, user prompts, and other inputs while presenting results back to the user.
2. **Orchestration Layer** – Coordinates models, tools, and memory components so the agent can decide what to do next.
3. **Foundation Models and Tools** – Provide language understanding, content generation, and the ability to interact with enterprise systems or third-party services.
4. **Governance and Safety** – Enforces policies, monitors for misuse, and ensures responses stay aligned with organizational standards.

## History of AI Agents
The idea of AI agents grew from the increasing sophistication of prompting techniques used with large language models. Early practitioners found that structured prompting templates—such as the Persona Pattern, step-by-step reasoning prompts, and AI Planning patterns—enabled models to simulate specialized roles, break down complex tasks, and coordinate multi-step plans reliably. These approaches proved so effective that teams began encapsulating them into reusable software scaffolding, eventually forming the foundation of the agent paradigm we see today.
