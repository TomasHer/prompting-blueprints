## Looking Ahead
The following publications are queued for deeper documentation. Details will be expanded as notes and outcomes are finalized.

- **Generative Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineeringâ€”A Research Agenda** ([Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.70005))
  - **Summary:** Literature review combined with five-month focus groups to map how GenAI is influencing software engineering and to propose a structured research agenda.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Catalogues 78 open research questions across 11 software-engineering areas.
    - Finds GenAI most effective for partial automation and decision support throughout the lifecycle.
    - Highlights evidence gaps in requirements, design, and education compared with implementation, QA, and maintenance.
    - Surfaces cross-cutting concerns around dependability, data access, transparency, and sustainability.
- **Generating Test Scenarios from NL Requirements Using Retrieval-Augmented LLMs: An Industrial Study** ([Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12772))
  - **Summary:** Introduces the RAGTAG approach (retrieval-augmented LLM pipeline) and evaluates it on two Austrian Post projects with bilingual requirements via expert assessment.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Produced scenarios rated relevant with strong coverage, coherence, and feasibility.
    - Demonstrates the need for a human-in-the-loop to refine correctness and domain nuance.
    - Emphasizes the importance of domain document retrieval to handle bilingual specifications.
- **Prioritizing Software Requirements Using Large Language Models** ([Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01564))
  - **Summary:** Presents a web-based prototype that applies AI agents and prompt engineering to automate or support requirement prioritization techniques.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Shows feasibility of LLM-assisted prioritization within Agile workflows.
    - Highlights time and budget savings plus more reproducible decision procedures.
    - Releases prototype code to enable experimentation and benchmarking versus human baselines.
- **A Multi-agent LLM System for Automated Requirements Analysis: A Study on User Story Generation and Prioritization** ([Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-04200-2_12))
  - **Summary:** Explores a role-based multi-agent stack (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.3, Mistral-Nemo) to generate user stories from project briefs and prioritize them with stakeholder-specific prompts.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Generated stories maintain strong functional relevance and semantic similarity to expert baselines.
    - Prioritization aligns moderately with expert rankings, especially for mid- and lower-priority items.
    - Notes run-to-run variability and uneven clarity or conciseness across different models.
- **LLM-Based Agents for Automating the Enhancement of User Story Quality: An Early Report** ([Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-61154-4_8))
  - **Summary:** Details the ALAS autonomous agent system piloted at Austrian Post to uplift user story quality across six Agile teams.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Reports improved clarity, specificity, and value articulation in refined stories.
    - Reinforces the need for product owner oversight to preserve context and integrity.
    - Positions agentic workflows as pragmatic for INVEST-aligned requirement quality checks.
- **Exploring Human-AI Collaboration in Agile: Customised LLM Meeting Assistants** ([Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14871))
  - **Summary:** Action-research deployments of AI meeting assistants tailored for Daily Scrum and feature refinement ceremonies, including readiness guidance and lessons learned.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Finds assistants most valuable in longer planning or review sessions where UX quality matters.
    - Provides a readiness and assessment checklist covering integration, data, and compliance factors.
    - Shows real-time recommendations are helpful but sensitive to configuration and prompting.
- **TimeLess: A Vision for the Next Generation of Software Development** ([Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08507))
  - **Summary:** Vision paper proposing multi-agent AI that captures meeting discussions and executes development tasks to shift meetings from planning to immediate action.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Targets reductions in delivery complexity, time, and cost through AI execution.
    - Envisions meetings generating tangible progress as agents act on decisions in real time.
    - Frames the future development environment as human strategic direction paired with automated follow-through.
