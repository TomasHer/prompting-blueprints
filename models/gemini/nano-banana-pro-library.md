A realistic cyber-aesthetic futuristic business card photograph: a left hand is holding a horizontal, acrylic, borderless card the size of a standard business card (3.5” x 2” ratio) fills most of the frame. The card is displaying a personal business card layout without any banners or backgrounds. It features sharp, rounded corners and emits a soft neon glow of blended hues of blue, pink, and purple. The background is dark and smooth, highlighted edges, giving the metallic elements of light appear finely engraved. The card surface is crystal-clear, and the text on the front appears finely engraved.

If a logo is provided, integrate it into the design; if not, create a clean typographic logo based on the company name.

Any field left blank automatically fill it with visually appealing and clear appropriate design elements.

The final business card should have a balanced layout, clean lines, and clear visual hierarchy, suitable for professional use.

## Prompt 2: Isometric city weather scene
_Image placeholder: Add the generated city scene image here._

PROMPT:

Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene of [CITY], featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural elements. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly into the city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.

Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.

At the top-center, place the title “[CITY]” in large bold text, a prominent weather icon beneath it, then the date (small text) and temperature (medium text). All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the tops of the buildings.
