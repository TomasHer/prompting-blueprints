Thanks for your interest!

## How to contribute
1. Open an issue describing your suggestion or bug.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
3. Add/update content and tests (see `/evaluations`).
4. Open a pull request describing the change.

## Style
- Keep prompts **copy-pasteable**.
- Prefer **small, focused** tips over long walls of text.
- Include **Why it works**, **Prompt**, **Variations**, **Failure modes**.
- Use ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD` in front matter (`last_updated`).
