# Vibe Research Playbook

## Intent
Guide research strategists and innovation teams on how to use "vibe research" workflows—fast synthesis of emerging patterns and signals—to inform hypotheses before committing to deeper, citation-driven studies.

## Use when
- You need directional insight or opportunity framing within hours, not days, but still want traceability for a subsequent deep-dive study.
- Leadership wants to pressure-test a concept using trend scans, metaphor analysis, or early market signals before funding a full research sprint.
- You plan to hand off a vibe brief to a deep research squad or to the [Deep Research Tools Playbook](../use-cases/deep-research.md) for validation and expansion.

## What "vibe" means in research
- **Pattern-first exploration.** Vibe research privileges pattern discovery over exhaustive sourcing, combining speculative synthesis with automated clustering to spark hypotheses.
- **Agent-amplified sensemaking.** Tools like ChatGPT Deep Research, Perplexity Deep Search, and Gemini Deep Research let teams iterate on prompts to test frames, tone, and metaphors before locking study protocols.
- **Bridge to rigor.** Practitioners still checkpoint findings with human review and plan the transition to formal literature reviews to avoid over-indexing on aesthetics or novelty alone.

> Adapted from insights shared by Albertina Bekhti on Medium, the On Tech Ethics podcast with CITI Program, and the MakeLaw Substack series, which all argue vibe research complements—not replaces—traditional scholarship by speeding exploratory sensemaking.

## Tool stack
| Layer | Purpose | Recommended setup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exploration agents | Rapidly assemble emerging narratives, competitive language, and community signals. | ChatGPT Deep Research, Perplexity Deep Search, Google Gemini Deep Research sessions with saved prompt histories. |
| Evidence triage | Sort literature, case studies, and news clippings into matrices for quick inspection. | [Elicit](https://elicit.com/) to synthesize 20 peer-reviewed studies into a 4x2 matrix (strength of evidence × novelty). |
| Signal clustering | Group metaphors, GTM messages, or product claims into themes for executive summaries. | Perplexity or ChatGPT list prompts filtered to post-2018 companies using biological metaphors; cluster outputs with spreadsheet pivot tables or Miro boards. |
| Storytelling | Package the vibe findings for stakeholders in concise decks or memos. | McKinsey-style report template with map of insurance research across three countries; annotate slides with data provenance for traceability. |

## Workflow
### Step 1 — Frame the vibe brief
1. Capture the prompt intent, target audience, and time budget. Reuse the role + constraints + format pattern to make the agent output copy-ready.
2. Pull contextual anchors from internal knowledge bases so the agents do not drift into irrelevant speculation.

### Step 2 — Spin up agent explorations
- Run three concurrent deep research threads (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) using variations of your core question. Log prompts, timestamps, and top citations for later audits.
- Ask for high-level narratives, outlier claims, and metaphor usage so you can understand both dominant and fringe vibes.

### Step 3 — Structure the signals
1. Use Elicit to translate raw citations into the 4x2 matrix; mark evidence strength with a color code so handoffs to the deep research team are smoother.
2. Combine agent-generated company lists with manual spot checks; group them into nature-themed SaaS clusters and attach suggested GTM theses.
3. Visualize the insurance research map with geographic layers (market size, regulatory headlines, incumbents vs. startups) to expose pattern gaps.

### Step 4 — Turn vibes into decisions
- Summarize the opportunity, risks, and unknowns in a one-page brief. Call out which signals require rigorous follow-up and link to the [Deep Research Tools Playbook](../use-cases/deep-research.md) plan for validation.
- Tag each insight with source type (peer-reviewed, podcast, analyst memo, community post) so teams can judge confidence quickly.
- Record what resonated with stakeholders to refine future vibe sprints and avoid repeating low-signal sources.

## Ethics and rigor guardrails
- **Clarify limitations.** Cite Albertina Bekhti’s framing that vibe research is hypothesis fuel, not proof, and should transition into structured inquiry before publication or policy changes.
- **Respect participant and community norms.** The On Tech Ethics podcast stresses transparent sourcing, respect for indigenous knowledge, and clear consent when referencing community-generated data.
- **Document decision trails.** MakeLaw’s analysis highlights legal scrutiny around AI-augmented research; keep change logs, prompt histories, and data lineage to withstand audits.

## Handoff checklist
- [ ] Matrix of emerging insights annotated with confidence levels and citations.
- [ ] Clustering map or storyboard summarizing metaphors, GTM angles, and visual references.
- [ ] Stakeholder brief documenting assumptions, open questions, and recommended deep research paths.
