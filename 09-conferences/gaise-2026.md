GAISE 2026 kicked off with a warm welcome from Prof. Pekka Abrahamsson and Virve Yli-Savola of GPT-Lab at Tampere University. They opened the summer school, set the stage for three days exploring how AI is reshaping software engineering, and introduced the program ahead.

### 🛠️ Workshop — Agent-first IDEs by Tomas Herda & Agnes Lipovits, Austrian Post Business Solutions

To kick off the session, I presented [#DAiTA — Intelligent Document Processing](https://www.post.at/en/g/c/daita) — Austrian Post's platform for AI-powered automation of business document workflows — as a real-world example of applied AI in enterprise operations.

The way we build software is changing rapidly. Modern Agent-first IDEs and coding agents such as Kiro, Google Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code no longer just autocomplete code — they can plan, implement, test, debug, and validate changes autonomously across entire repositories. At the same time, the industry is moving from prompt-driven coding toward **spec-driven autonomous engineering**, where agents execute structured specifications, constraints, and acceptance criteria instead of relying on ad-hoc prompts alone.

This hands-on workshop introduced the key concepts behind reliable AI-assisted development: Context Engineering, reusable Skills, AGENTS.md, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and persistent AI knowledge bases (wikis) that let agents accumulate and reuse project knowledge across sessions. The first half covered the concepts and tooling behind agent-first development; the second half was fully practical — participants built and experimented with a working setup directly on their own laptops.

**Interesting observations**

- **Context over cleverness.** The session anchored on a line from Andrej Karpathy: *"90% of Claude's mistakes come from missing context, not a weak model."* Most failures aren't model failures — they're context failures.
- **Context engineering vs. prompt engineering.** The analogy ran throughout: entire environment info vs. a single query, a screenplay vs. a sticky note, a complete system (docs, examples, rules, patterns, guardrails) vs. clever wording, continuous curation vs. a one-time instruction — memory, tools, data, schemas, and project context vs. a few few-shot examples. See [Context Engineering](https://github.com/TomasHer/prompting-blueprints/blob/main/02-ai-agents/03-context-and-memory/context-engineering.md).
- **Prompting patterns still matter.** A tour through reusable prompting patterns — Persona, Question Refinement, Flipped Interaction, Chain-of-Thought, Zero-Shot, and Few-Shot — and how each fits reasoning LLMs ([Effective prompts for reasoning LLMs](https://gpt-lab.eu/effective-prompts-for-reasoning-llms/)).
- **What makes an IDE *agentic*?** The components: Repository, Chat Window, Agent Configuration, Agent Orchestration, Agent Definitions, Skills, MCP & Tools, and Human-in-the-loop.
- **AGENTS.md.** An introduction to the AGENTS.md convention and a reusable template for steering agents with project context ([Agent context window & performance](https://github.com/TomasHer/prompting-blueprints/blob/main/02-ai-agents/03-context-and-memory/agent-context-window-performance.md)).
- **Anatomy of a Skill.** How reusable Skills are structured and how they tie back into context engineering ([Anatomy of a Skill](https://github.com/TomasHer/prompting-blueprints/blob/main/02-ai-agents/02-skills/anatomy-of-a-skill.md)).
- **Personal AI knowledge base.** A live use case built with Obsidian + MCP (or the open-source alternative [Logseq](https://logseq.com)), echoing Karpathy's own AI knowledge-base workflow ([AI knowledge base tutorial](https://github.com/TomasHer/prompting-blueprints/blob/main/02-ai-agents/03-context-and-memory/ai-knowledge-base-tutorial.md#implementation-claude-obsidian)). Demonstrated by building a **Product Owner handbook** and walking through [Prompting Blueprints](https://github.com/TomasHer/prompting-blueprints) — my personal AI knowledge base.
- **Hands-on: AI Bug Detective.** The interactive part put predefined agents and skills to work in a Replit project — [AI Bug Detective](https://replit.com/@laxxli/ai-bug-detective).

### 🎤 Keynote — When Software Stops Waiting: Life in Autonomous AI Systems by Alex Polyakov, CEO @ ProjectSimple

<img src="../assets/conferences/gaise-2026/day1/02-keynote/keynote1.png" alt="When Software Stops Waiting — keynote by Alex Polyakov">

AI is changing far more than how code is written — software systems are starting to observe, decide, and act with ever less human involvement. Tracing the thread back to *"The first AI-Assisted Agile Software Engineering workshop"* he ran with Prof. Pekka Abrahamsson at XP Amsterdam on 13 June 2023, Alex Polyakov walked through what is already **dead**, what is rapidly **dying**, and what stays **very much alive** in the age of autonomous AI systems. His core message: agents make the coding fast, but the value — and the bottleneck — now lives in human judgment, ownership, and the checkpoints that keep autonomy honest.

<img src="../assets/conferences/gaise-2026/day1/02-keynote/keynote2.HEIC" alt="Human-in-the-Loop vs. Autonomous Agents — where agents struggle without human checkpoints">

**Interesting observations**

- **Autonomous agents cut both ways.** Done right they deliver real gains — ~50% faster cycle time, ~35% fewer open bugs, ~40% more test coverage, ~60% faster incident recovery, and ~80% fresher docs. Done wrong, the failure modes are severe: deleted production databases, secrets logged in plain text, read-only modes overridden, and safety/approval loops bypassed.
- **Human-in-the-Loop is what closes those gaps.** Practices like work decomposition, iterative delivery, code review, a shared definition of done, requirement clarification, acceptance testing, architectural decision records, pair programming, and reversible rollbacks are exactly where agents fall short.
- **Where autonomous agents struggle (mostly high-severity):** scope drift, front-loaded execution, self-review blind spots, completion uncertainty, silent assumption propagation, teaching to the test, no rationale memory, asymmetric dialogue (they can't push back), and irreversibility blindness.
- **The Agile lesson still holds:** the more work is in progress, the slower it gets done. AI accelerates output, but human bottlenecks create the wait — Alex framed it via Kent Beck's Theory of Constraints ("see where the bags are piling up") and a baggage-claim metaphor: AI coding is *fast*, while human-in-the-loop and review/approve are the *waiting* states where work piles up.
- **Backlog thought experiment:** he contrasted how the backlog of **1 person + a 24/7 autonomous AI** looks versus **5 devs using human-in-the-loop** — output isn't the constraint, the human review states are.
- **Dead, Dying, Very Much Alive game** — Dead: PR-less merge, manual test generation, Scrum, the "10x developer." Dying: hand-coding, code ownership, line-by-line PR review. Very much alive: architectural design, Agile, product managers, and software engineers.
- **Five takeaways:**
<br>(1) autonomous agents aren't new — hallucination without judgment has always changed outcomes, and model size doesn't fix it;
<br>(2) human-in-the-loop beats full autonomy for now;
<br>(3) complex work needs more than intelligence — architecture, prioritization, naming, and incident calls stay human;
<br>(4) the biggest value is **Intelligent Automation (IA)**, reached through contextual awareness rather than bigger models;
<br>(5) **tokens are the new currency**, but AI commoditization is inevitable — ask what's optimizing whom.
- **Some memorable lines and data points:** *"Early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."* On average **65% of a team's work is unplanned**, **token usage is the new KPI**, and — most pointedly — *"You cannot delegate ownership: let the people decide what we work on, describe the problem, and let the team solve the issue."*
