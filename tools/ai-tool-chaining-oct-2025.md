## Chaining Guidance
- Start with **Perplexity** for current facts and citations, move to **Claude 4.5** for deep structuring or legal-safe drafting, and finish with **ChatGPT-5** for multimodal polish or automation hooks.
- Switch back to Perplexity whenever you need to refresh references or validate claims before publishing.
- Use Claude 4.5 as the safety filter when handling confidential or compliance-heavy material, especially after broad ideation in ChatGPT-5.

## Team Strategy Insight
- The smartest teams don’t chase “the best AI.” They pick the right one for the job and learn how to speak its language. Created October 2025; revisit this mix as the landscape evolves.
