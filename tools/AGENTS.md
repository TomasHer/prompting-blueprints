# AGENTS.md â€” `tools/`

## Scope
Covers Markdown in `tools/`.

## Goal
Explain how to operationalize third-party products alongside Prompting Blueprints assets.

## Structure template
1. **Tool snapshot**: positioning, ideal use cases, pricing/availability considerations.
2. **Setup**: minimal steps to get started (include CLI commands or UI navigation as needed).
3. **Playbook**: numbered tasks or flows, referencing relevant patterns/prompts.
4. **Guardrails**: safety, compliance, or failure recovery tips.
5. **Examples**: short transcript or screenshot description demonstrating expected outcomes.
6. **Next steps**: suggested automations, evaluations, or integrations.

## Style cues
- Prefer tables for plan comparisons or feature matrices.
- Keep instructions vendor-neutral and avoid speculation; focus on reproducible steps.
- Flag beta/experimental features explicitly.

## Review checklist
- Confirm setup commands were verified recently; include "last validated <month year>" notes where helpful.
- Ensure screenshots or media assets live in `assets/` with descriptive filenames.
- Link to evaluations or monitoring recommendations if the tool is used to score prompts.
