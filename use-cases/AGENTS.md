# AGENTS.md â€” `use-cases/`

## Scope
Applies to Markdown under `use-cases/`.

## Intent
Capture end-to-end workflows that combine patterns, prompt packs, and tools to solve a real scenario.

## Required sections
1. **Scenario summary**: who, what, desired outcome, constraints.
2. **Prerequisites**: data sources, accounts, tools, and key patterns/prompts to review.
3. **Workflow steps**: numbered stages describing inputs, recommended prompts, and expected assistant behavior.
4. **Example run-through**: realistic sample inputs and resulting outputs (trim or anonymize sensitive data).
5. **Quality checklist**: how to evaluate success, edge cases, or follow-up automation ideas.
6. **References & handoffs**: link to supporting assets, evaluations, or automations.

## Writing guidance
- Use second-person voice to instruct the practitioner.
- When referencing prompts or patterns, link directly and cite the exact section or anchor when possible.
- Supplement with diagrams or screenshots only when they materially clarify the workflow (keep assets lightweight).

## Review gates
- Steps should map cleanly to either existing prompts/patterns or clearly specify what new material is required.
- Example outputs must align with the stated **Quality checklist**.
- Consider adding/updating evaluations if the use case introduces structured outputs or critical quality bars.
