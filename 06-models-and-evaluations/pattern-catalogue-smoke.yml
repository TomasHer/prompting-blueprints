  - description: Persona pattern output cites the role and constraints before giving guidance.
    prompt: |
      Act as a cybersecurity incident responder who specializes in cloud infrastructure breaches.
      Maintain a calm, plain-language voice for stressed stakeholders.

      OUTPUT: Respond using the following structure exactly:
      Persona: <role summary in one sentence> (Tone: <tone description>)

      Within the scope of enterprise data governance for a multinational retailer, suggest a better version of the following question:
      "How can we fix data issues quickly?"
      Explain why your revision will lead to a more useful answer.

      Why it helps: <2-3 sentence rationale>

  - description: Template pattern response fills every placeholder with context-aware details.
    prompt: |
      You must use the following template exactly:
      ### Deliverable: Cloud Cost Optimization Brief
      Problem Statement: <one sentence>
      Solution Outline:
      - Step 1: <detail>
      - Step 2: <detail>
      Metrics to Track:
      - <metric>
      - <metric>
      Next Checkpoint: <date or timeframe>
      Use the context below to populate each placeholder without leaving anything blank.
      If information is missing, infer a reasonable placeholder instead of writing "TBD".
      CONTEXT:
