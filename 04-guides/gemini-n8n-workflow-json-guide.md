# Gemini 3 Pro Prompting Guide for n8n Workflow JSON Templates

This guide shows how to prompt **Gemini 3 Pro** to generate an **n8n workflow template in JSON format** that you can import into n8n. It is based on the workflow design approach demonstrated in the tutorial: <https://youtu.be/Vb1SwBAn9cQ>.

## What you will build
You will write a prompt that:
1. Describes your automation goal and constraints.
2. Lists the n8n nodes you expect (triggers, actions, data transforms).
3. Asks Gemini 3 Pro to return **only valid n8n workflow JSON**.
4. Produces a JSON template you can import into n8n and customize.

## Prerequisites
- An n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).
- Access to **Gemini 3 Pro**.
- A clear description of your workflow (trigger, inputs, outputs, integrations).

## Prompting strategy (high-level)
Use structured prompting to keep Gemini focused on valid n8n workflow JSON.

**Key rules for Gemini:**
- Output **only JSON** (no backticks, no commentary).
- Target an **n8n workflow export format**, with a `nodes` array and `connections` object.
- Include **node types** and **credentials placeholders** rather than secrets.
- Name nodes clearly to make the workflow readable.

## Prompt template (copy/paste)
Replace the bracketed placeholders with your workflow details.

```
You are an n8n workflow designer. Create a valid n8n workflow JSON template.

Workflow goal:
[Describe the automation goal in 2-4 sentences.]

Trigger:
[What starts the workflow? Example: Webhook, Schedule Trigger, Gmail Trigger.]

Inputs:
[Describe the input payload shape or example JSON.]

Required integrations:
[List the services and actions (e.g., "Google Sheets: append row", "Slack: post message").]

Logic/steps:
[Numbered steps describing transformations, filters, branching, or error handling.]

Constraints:
- Use n8n node types compatible with the described services.
- Include placeholders for credentials (do not embed secrets).
- Return ONLY valid JSON for an n8n workflow export.
- Include node names and positions for readability.

Output format:
- Return ONLY JSON.
- The JSON must include: "nodes", "connections", and "settings".
```

## Example prompt (realistic)
```
You are an n8n workflow designer. Create a valid n8n workflow JSON template.

Workflow goal:
When a new Typeform response arrives, summarize the response with Gemini 3 Pro,
store the summary in Google Sheets, and send a Slack notification.

Trigger:
Typeform Trigger

Inputs:
Typeform response fields include: name, email, company, free_text_feedback.

Required integrations:
- Typeform: receive responses
- Gemini 3 Pro (HTTP Request or OpenAI-compatible node): summarize response
- Google Sheets: append row
- Slack: post message

Logic/steps:
1. Trigger on new Typeform response.
2. Build a prompt that includes name, company, and free_text_feedback.
3. Call Gemini 3 Pro to produce a 3-5 sentence summary.
4. Append a row to Google Sheets with name, email, summary, and timestamp.
5. Post a Slack message with the name and summary.

Constraints:
- Use n8n node types compatible with the described services.
- Include placeholders for credentials (do not embed secrets).
- Return ONLY valid JSON for an n8n workflow export.
- Include node names and positions for readability.

Output format:
- Return ONLY JSON.
- The JSON must include: "nodes", "connections", and "settings".
```

## Validate the JSON output
Before importing:
- Ensure Gemini returned **only JSON** (no extra text).
- Confirm that each node has `type`, `typeVersion`, `parameters`, `position`, and `name`.
- Confirm that `connections` maps node names to outgoing edges.

If the JSON is invalid, ask Gemini to fix it with a targeted follow-up:

```
Fix the JSON so it is a valid n8n workflow export. Return ONLY JSON.
```

## Import into n8n
1. Open your n8n editor.
2. Click **Workflows → Import from File** (or **Import from clipboard**).
3. Paste the JSON generated by Gemini.
4. Review each node, add credentials, and adjust fields.
5. Save and run the workflow.

## Troubleshooting tips
- **Wrong node type:** Ask Gemini to use the specific n8n node (e.g., `n8n-nodes-base.slack`).
- **Missing connections:** Ask for explicit connections between node names.
- **Invalid JSON:** Ask Gemini to return only valid JSON and remove all commentary.
- **Credentials confusion:** Ensure the JSON uses placeholders and you set credentials in n8n.

## Best practices for production-ready templates
- Use a **Set** node to normalize fields early.
- Add **IF** nodes for branching and error handling.
- Include a **NoOp** or **Merge** node to consolidate branches if needed.
- Add a **Summary** section in your prompt to enforce output consistency.

## Next steps
- Extend the prompt with your exact data schema.
- Ask Gemini to add retries or error reporting.
- Version your workflow JSON in Git to track changes over time.
