# AI Adoption Readiness Guide

## Intent
Equip transformation leaders with a concise checklist that signals whether their organization is prepared to scale AI responsibly and sustainably.

## Snapshot
An AI-ready organization demonstrates cultural, technical, and operational maturity before rolling out models. Use the eight green flags below as a scorecard. If most of them describe your team, you are ready to accelerate pilots into production programs; if not, treat the gaps as prerequisites for your next wave of AI investments.

## 8 Green Flags of an AI-Ready Organization
1. **They clean and structure data before expecting results.** Prioritize high-quality, well-governed data pipelines so pilots have reliable inputs and measurable outcomes.
2. **They build workflows before buying tools.** Map how AI will slot into existing processes and decision trees, then select platforms that reinforce those flows instead of creating workarounds.
3. **They prioritize practical use cases over AI hype.** Rank opportunities by business value, feasibility, and risk, keeping the roadmap grounded in real problems your teams need solved.
4. **They empower people instead of blaming “AI adoption issues.”** Invest in training, change management, and feedback loops that let employees experiment, learn, and influence roadmap decisions.
5. **They involve security and legal issues early, not at the end.** Bring risk, compliance, and privacy stakeholders into design reviews so safeguards are baked in rather than bolted on.
6. **They measure behavior change, not just accuracy.** Track adoption metrics—workflow completion, decision quality, employee sentiment—to confirm the AI system is changing how work gets done.
7. **They accept AI learning is iterative, not instant.** Normalize phased rollouts, incremental tuning, and continuous evaluation instead of expecting perfection on day one.
8. **They create internal AI champions instead of outsourcing everything.** Build a bench of cross-functional advocates who can translate between business needs and technical capabilities.

## How to Use This Guide
- Treat each flag as a go/no-go gate before expanding AI pilots.
- Assign owners for any red or yellow flags and document specific remediation steps.
- Re-run the checklist quarterly to capture new risks, tools, or regulatory changes.
